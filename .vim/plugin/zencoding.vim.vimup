  Tips:
  
  You can customize behavior of expanding with overriding config.
  This configuration will be marged at loading plugin. 
  
    let g:user_zen_settings = {
    \  'indentation' : '  ',
    \  'perl' : {
    \    'aliases' : {
    \      'req' : 'require '
    \    },
    \    'snippets' : {
    \      'use' : "use strict\nuse warnings\n\n",
    \      'warn' : "warn \"|\";",
    \    }
    \  }
    \}

    let g:user_zen_expandabbr_key = '<c-e>'

    let g:use_zen_complete_tag = 1

  You can set language attribute in html using zen_settings['lang'].
